    <h2>Where has 2020-2023 fashion trends orginated from</h2>
    <p>The fashions of the 2020s represent a departure from 2010s fashion and feature a nostalgia for older aesthetics. They have been largely inspired by styles of the early to mid-2000s, late 1990s, 1980s, 1970s, and 1960s Early in the decade, several publications noted the shortened trend and nostalgia cycle in 2020s fashion.</p>
    
<p>In the 2020s, many companies, including current fashion giants such as Shein and Shekou, have been using social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram as a marketing tool. Marketing strategies involving third parties, particularly influencers and celebrities, have become prominent tactics. E-commerce platforms which promote small businesses, such as Depop and Etsy, grew by offering vintage, homemade, or resold clothing from individual sellers. Thrifting has also exploded in popularity, due to it being centered around finding valuable pieces of clothing at a reasonable price.</p>
<p>Popular brands in the United Kingdom, United States, and Australia during this era include Adidas, Nike, New Balance, Globe International, Vans, Kappa, Tommy Hilfiger, Asics, Ellesse, Ralph Lauren, Forever 21, Urban Outfitters, Playboy, and The North Face. </p>

    <h2>Revival of old trends</h2>
    <p>As the decade began, fashions of the late 1990s and early to mid-2000s made a comeback, as many younger women worldwide rejected the form-fitting clothes that were a staple of 2010s fashion. In late 2020, younger British and American women abandoned skinny jeans for sweatpants, sweat suits, leggings, bike shorts,  baggy pants; mom jeans, low rise pants, overalls, shortalls, pants with drawstring waists, studded belts, zip up denim jumpsuits with large pockets, boot cut pants, pink velour tracksuits, cowboy boots popularized by Taylor Swift, sequined tops and metallic shorts popularized by Rihanna and Beyonce, leather skirts, ankle length skirts, sheer skirts; and culottes.</p>

<p>From 2020 to 2022, desirable colours in the US and Europe included navy blue, neon green, electric blue, purple, black, white, coral, baby pink, light grey, silver, pastel pink, violet, pale blue, lavender, mint green, faded yellow, pastel teal, lemon yellow, orange, red, and brown. </p>
